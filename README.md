Ansible Runner ZeroMQ Event Emitter
===================================

This project is a plugin for [Ansible Runner](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner) that allows emitting Ansible status and events to ZeroMQ. This can allow `Runner` to notify other systems as Ansible jobs are run and to deliver key events to that system if it's interested.
